Diveboard is Open Source and Non-Profit, which means it depends on the generosity of our Patrons to exist.

If you're in the US, we're a 501(c)-3 which means your donation is tax-deductible.

## Platform Pillars
- Primary goal: Help recreational divers keep track and share their Scuba experiences.
- Secondary goal: Offer an efficient discovery mechanism through the experiences of fellow divers to efficiently find out the Diving oportunities in a region, what species you can hope to see and what are the usual diving conditions and what disve shop may be best suited for you.
- Secondary goal: Collect citizen-science data such as Dive profiles or species sightings and make it available to support research projects.
